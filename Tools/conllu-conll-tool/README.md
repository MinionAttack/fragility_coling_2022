## Summary

This is a tool to convert *CoNLL-U* format files to *CoNLL* format files and manipulate training, validation and test sets.

This script has fifteen features:

1. Convert files in *CoNLL-U* format to *CoNLL* format.
2. Combine several files of a given training phase into one file.
3. Split a training phase file into two files, one file for the training phase and one file for the validation phase.
4. Clean up an embeddings file to remove the first line containing the number of words and the size of the vector.
5. Adds a label with random values for a specific dimension to the unknown words in the embedding file, either at a specific position or at
   the end of the file. A fixed seed is used to be able to reproduce the experiments.
6. Generate an embedding file with the words from the training file and the validation file with random values for a specific dimension. A
   fixed seed is used to be able to reproduce the experiments.
7. Adds the required number of columns to the end of each line of a *CoNLL* file to match the *CoNLL-U* format of 10 tab-separated columns.
8. Removes POS information on every line of a sentence. The content is replaced by a _.

**It is important to note that the script uses the _output_ folder as the base directory for both input and output files in some features.**

## How to use

Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

`$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To run the script, from a terminal in the root directory, type:

`$ ./conllu-conll-tool.py`

This will show the usage:

```
usage: conllu-conll-tool.py [-h]
                            {convert,combine,split,clean,fill,generate,columns,remove-pos,ttest,swap,remove-column,add-column,empty-nodes,enhanced-ud,extract}
                            ...

Convert CoNLL-U files to CoNLL files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Commands:

    convert             Convert from CoNLL-U format to CoNLL format.
    combine             Combine multiple files from one phase (train,
                        validation or test) into one file.
    split               In case there is no validation file (dev), the
                        training file (train) is split in two with a random
                        80-20 ratio.
    clean               Cleans up an embedding file by removing the first line
                        with the number of words and the vector size.
    fill                Add a label (with the given name) for unknown words
                        with random values, using a fixed seed for the given
                        dimension.
    generate            Generates a random embeddings file with the specified
                        dimension from the training and validation file.
    columns             Adds the required number of columns to the end of each
                        line of a CoNLL file to match the CoNLL-U format of 10
                        tab-separated columns.
    remove-pos          Removes POS information on every line of a sentence.
                        The content is replaced by a _.
```

If you want to know how to use a specific command, for example the *clean* command, type:

`$ ./conllu-conll-tool.py clean --help`

And it will show the help:

```
usage: conllu-conll-tool.py clean [-h] --input INPUT --output OUTPUT

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --input INPUT    Input files folder
  --output OUTPUT  Output files folder
```

### Note

If you get an error that you do not have permissions to run the script, type:

`$ chmod u+x conllu-conll-tool.py`

Run the script again.

## Examples

### 1. Convert files

`$ ./conllu-conll-tool.py convert --input conllu --output conll`

- **input**: Directory (must have been created) within the *output* folder where the *CoNLL-U* files to be converted are located.
    - You can put the files directly or if you want to convert several languages you can put the files in different folders (one for each  
      language), but be aware that the script does not process more than one level of subdirectories.
- **output**: Directory (must have been created) within the *output* folder where the converted *CoNLL* files shall be created.

### 2. Combine files

`$ ./conllu-conll-tool.py combine --input conllu --output combined --type train`

- **input**: Directory (must have been created) within the *output* folder where the *CoNLL-U* files to be combined are located.
